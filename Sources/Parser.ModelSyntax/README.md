# P3 Model Syntax

**P3 Model Syntax contains all default elements and relations and base abstractions to extend the model. It's base for both code analysis and output formatting.**

## Usage

This package is not intended for direct usage unless you'd like to build your own parser but use P3 Model elements and relations.
If you'd like to extend P3 Model Parser use existing extensibility points defined in [`P3Model.CodeAnalysis.Abstractions`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/P3Model.Parser.CodeAnalysis.Abstractions/) and [`Parser.OutputFormatting.Abstractions`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/P3Model.Parser.OutputFormatting.Abstractions/) packages.

## P3 Model project

P3 Model is a tool to automatically generate documentation from your source code.  
Generated documentation is based on information already present in the code and additional metadata added with annotations and JSON or Markdown files.  
Each technology like .net or Java has its own tooling. This library is a part of .net tooling.
